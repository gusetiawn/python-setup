Installation Step Python on MacOS

1. Check Python Installation:
   First, you should check if Python is already installed on your Mac. Open Terminal and type python --version or python3 --version and press Enter. If Python is installed, it will display the version number. If not, you'll see an error message.

3. Install Homebrew (optional):
   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software packages. You can skip this step if you prefer to install Python directly without Homebrew.To install Homebrew, open Terminal and paste the following command:

   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

3. Install Python with Homebrew (optional):
   If you decided to use Homebrew, you can install Python by running the following command in Terminal:
   brew install python
